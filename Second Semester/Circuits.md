In analysing ideal op-amp circuits, two important properties will be used:
1. The two inputs $V^{+}$ and $V^{-}$ are at the same potential, assuming $A=\infty$
2. Current into an op-amp input $I_{in}=0$ since  $R_{in}=\infty$.

Note that the op-amp is used with feedback since in open-loop, the op-amp saturates because of the very high (200,000 in the case of **Practical** op-amps) open-loop gain

For example: 
consider 
$V_{d}=1mV$ $V_{o}=200000\centerdot1mV$
That would lead to a value of $V_{o}=2000V$
which of course the op-amp will not reach before saturating.

Moreover the feedback must be negative feedback, i.e. the output feedback must go into the inverting terminal, otherwise may god be with us all.


We will be looking at the following **amplifier circuits**:

$V^{+}=V^{-}$
