A bode Plot (or diagram) consists of 2 graphs: a magnitude plot and a phase plot. The first plot of logarithmic magnitude of the transfer function in dBs against frequency. The phase plot is also a plot against frequency, this time representing the phase change introduced by the system to a sinusoidal signal. The standard representation of logarithmic magnitude of $G\left(j\omega\right)$ is:$$20\left|\log\right|G\left(j\omega\right)\Vert$$ in base 10. The curves obtained are drawn on semilog paper, using log scale for frequency and the linear scale for either magnitude (in dB) or phase (in degrees)
