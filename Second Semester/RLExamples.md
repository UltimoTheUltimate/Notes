$$GH=\frac{1}{s\left(s+2\right)}$$
- We have no zeros, 2 poles at $s=0,s=-2$
- no of branches = no of poles = 2
- asymptotes = nos of poles - no of zeros:
- $$2-0=2$$
- centre of asymptotes: $\sigma=\frac{-\left(0+2\right)-0}{2}=-1$
- angle of asymptotes: $\beta=\frac{\left(2l+1\right)}{n-m}x180\degree$
- $\beta=90\degree$
- $\beta=270\degree$
- Next, determine breakaway point:
	- I have a branch between s = 0 and s = -2, which is going to break to go over the asymptotes at which point will it break?
- $$\frac{1}{\sigma_{b}+0}+\frac{1}{\sigma_{b}+2}=0$$
- $$\frac{1}{\sigma_{b}}+\frac{1}{\sigma_{b}+2}=0$$
- $\sigma_{b}+2+\sigma_{b}=0$
- $$2\sigma_{b}=-2$$
As k increases, the poles go closer to each other, at a particular value, poles reach asymptotes and shoot one upward and one downward, as k increases further, the oscillations also increase more, since the poles are further away from the real axis.

As k increases, poles still cant get to other side, thus system cant go unstable, system will oscillate with larger amplitudes.
