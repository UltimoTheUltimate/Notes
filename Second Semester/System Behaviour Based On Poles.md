The number of poles denotes the order of the system:

**1** pole --> **1st** order system
**2** poles --> **2nd** order system

If one plots the poles on an Argand diagram, the following regions will describe the behaviour of the system:

The **Left** Side is **Stable**, The Middle is Marginally Stable, The Right is Unstable

Note: What isn't shown in this diagram is conjugate imaginary roots on the y axis which gives rise to marginally stable oscillatory behaviour (consistent sinusoidal feedback)
