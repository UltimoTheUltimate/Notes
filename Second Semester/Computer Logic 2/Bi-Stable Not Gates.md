For this circuit to be [[Bi-Stable Not Gates|Bi-Stable]], an even number of gates must be used, otherwise the system will be unstable.

While this logic circuit is a [[Bi-Stable System]], it cannot be modified, and even so, it needs to be initialised to a specific state, as otherwise there would be a cycle of state changes, as everything would be set to low.
