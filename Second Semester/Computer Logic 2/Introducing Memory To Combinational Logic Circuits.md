Combinational logic, in essence, does not allow for memory, or the saving of states. However, using ideas from within Sequential Logic, this is possible. 

To obtain memory within a logic circuit, one has to create a [[Bi-Stable System]] that can easily maintain its state, without erratic behaviour or change.

There Are 3 ways to add Memory:

[[Bi-Stable Not Gates]]

[[Latches]]

[[Flip-Flops]]

Nowadays, Flip-Flops are used most due to their clock dependence.
