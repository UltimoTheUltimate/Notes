Consider the phase shift of a dominant pole amplifier, where $f_d$ is the non-dominant pole frequency. Each pole results in a $-90^\circ$ phase shift.

Consider the first pole at $f_d$.
At this frequency, the dominant 3-dB frequency, the phase shift is $-45^\circ$.

As the frequency increases, the phase shift becomes $-90^\circ$.

As the frequency increases further towards $f_t$, the effect of the non-dominant $f_{nd}$ pole starts to increase the phase shift beyond $-90^\circ$.

Let the additional phase shifts at the unity-gain frequency $f_t$ be $\phi_2$.
As the frequency increases further beyond $f_t$, the phase shift will become $-135^\circ$ when the frequency reaches $f_{nd}$.
Then as the frequency increases beyond $f_{nd}$, the phase shift goes to $-180^\circ$.
