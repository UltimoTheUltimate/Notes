In general the open loop transfer function has the following form:
$$G\left(s\right)H\left(s\right)=\frac{k\left(s+z_1\right)\left(s+z_2\right)\ldots\left(s+z_{m}\right)}{\left(s+_{}P_1\right)\left(s+p_2\right)\ldots\left(s+p_{n}\right)}$$
where $m\le n$
$-z_{},-z_2\ldots$ are the roots of the numerator polynomial i.e. zeros of $G\left(s\right)H\left(s\right)$. 
$-p_{},-p_2\ldots$ are the roots of the denominator polynomial i.e. poles of $G\left(s\right)H\left(s\right)$. 

- The Poles of the closed loop transfer function (given by solving $1+G\left(s\right)H\left(s\right)=0$) depend on the poles and zeros of the open loop transfer function; $-p_{i}$, and $-z_{i}$, and also on $k$ 
- Thus, varying the gain $k$ of the open loop transfer function will change the characteristic equation and hence the closed loop poles.
