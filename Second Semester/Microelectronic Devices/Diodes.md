There are 3 Models of Diode:

#### ==**Ideal**==
This Model works simply as a one way gate. Infinite Resistance one way, No resistance the other way.

Ideal VI Curve:
#### **==Linear==**
This Model is similar to the ideal model, but the diode only conducts if the bias is more than a specified voltage, usually 0.7V

Linear VI Curve:
#### **==Piece-Wise Linear==**
This is similar to the Linear Model, but also has an internal resistance.

Piece-Wise Linear VI Curve:
