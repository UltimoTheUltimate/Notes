The Gain Bandwidth is defined as the product of the low frequency voltage gain $A_{v_o}$ and the dominant pole frequency. 

$GBW = A_{v_o} \cdot f_d$

For a dominant pole frequency response, the gain bandwidth product is a constant up to $f_T$. 

Thus in closed loop conditions, with the closed loop voltage gain $A_{CL}$, and closed loop 3-dB frequency $f_{CL}$,

$GBW = A_{CL} \cdot f_{CL}$

\therefore at unity gain,  
$GBW = 1 \cdot f_T$
or f_T = GBW
