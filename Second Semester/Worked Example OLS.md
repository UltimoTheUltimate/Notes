Assume G has a constant value of 10 and is now changed to 11, in this case:
$$\frac{\partial G}{G}=\frac{11-10}{10}=0.1$$
and

$$\frac{\partial Y}{Y}=S_{G}^{Y}·\frac{\partial G}{G}=S_{G}^{Y}·0.1$$

$$=0.1$$
Thus, a 10% parameter change results in a 10% change in the overall transfer function.

- This means that the output variations are directly proportional to variations in the open loop transfer function 
	- Thus, in an open loop system there is little protection from uncertainties or disturbances.
