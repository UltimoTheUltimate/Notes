$I_D$ vs $V_{DS}$
![[Pasted image 20250220113918.png]]
the initial slope is the ohmic region,
the flattening for each voltage is the cutoff region

The $I_D$ vs $V_{DS}$ characteristics are plotted for different values of $V_{GS}$

There are 3 regions of operation:
cut-off - transistor is off
ohmic 
pinchoff

Note also that in the pinchoff region, the current $I_D$ is constant and thus independent of $V_{DS}$  
Also note that the current $I_G$ into the gate is 0 since the silicon dioxide layer in the transistor cross section is an insulator
