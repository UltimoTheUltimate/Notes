The actual load M2 is now an active current source, i.e. an MOS transistor operating in pinch-off.

DC operation

$V_{out}=V_{DD}-V_{SD2}$
$V_{out}=V_{DS1}$

Consider: $$V_{in}<V_{TN}$$
$M1$ is off
$\therefore I_D=0$
$V_{out}=V_{DD}-IR$ drop across $M2$ (where IR drop is 0 as I is 0)

Consider now:
$$V_{in}=V_{TN}^+$$
M1 switches on in pinchoff

$I_{D}$ starts to flow.

As $V_{in}$ increases further, the current increases $\therefore V_{out}=V_{DD}-$ "IR" drop across M2 
$\therefore V_{out}\downarrow\downarrow$  

Finally

when:

$$V_{in}\rightarrow V_{DD}$$
$V_{out}\rightarrow$ a few mV
as M1 $\rightarrow$ ohmic region

Transfer Characteristic:

$V_{out}$ Vs $V_{in}$
