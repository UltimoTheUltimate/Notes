In a practical MOS, as VGS increases, pinch off of the channel occurs at a point in the channel away from the drain end. This causes the drain current in pinch-off to increase slightly, since the effective length of the effective channel decreases.

The pinch off current equation becomes:

$$I_D=\frac{K'}{2}\frac{W}{L}(V_{GS}-V_T)^2(1+\lambda_{DS})$$

where $\lambda$ is called the channel length modulation parameter. Thus due to channel-length modulation, $I_D$ is slightly dependent also on $V_{DS}$
