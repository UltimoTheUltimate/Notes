To analyse system behaviour in time, we need to consider its behaviour in the **time domain**.

Time response is given by: 
$$y\left(t\right)=y_{t}\left(t\right)+y_{ss}\left(t\right)$$

 Where:
 $y_{t}\left(t\right)$ is the [[Transient Response]]



$y_{ss}\left(t\right)$ is the [[Steady State Response]]
