Signals can be:
- Periodic
	- Completes a pattern within a measurable time frame
	- Repeats the same pattern over subsequent identical periods
	- $x(t+T_o)=x(t)$ or $x[n]=x[n+N],N=2\pi m/\Omega_o$
	- typical of analogue signals
- Aperiodic
- Does not exhibit a pattern or cycle that repeats over time
- Typical of digital signals
We can analyse the signals in:
- Time domain
- Frequency domain
