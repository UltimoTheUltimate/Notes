$$\frac{C\left(s\right)}{R\left(s\right)}=\frac{\omega n^2}{s^2+2\zeta\omega ns+\omega n^2}$$
By differentiating the output equation of a second order system and equating it to zero, to solve for t, the time at which maxima and minima can be found.

$$t=\frac{n\pi}{\omega n\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}$$
where n = 0,1,2 ...

Maximum overshoot:

$$t_{\max}=\frac{\pi}{\omega n\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}$$
The percentage maximum overshoot at this point is given by:

$$100e^{\frac{-\pi\zeta}{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}}$$
Approximate results for the time delay $t_{d}$ and the rise time $t_{r}$ are given respectively by:

$$t_{d}≈\frac{1+0.7\zeta}{\omega n}$$
$$t_{r}≈\frac{0.8+2.5\zeta}{\omega n}$$
for $0<\zeta<1$
