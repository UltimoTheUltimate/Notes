Consider the full inverter amplifier circuits which has 2 nodes, one at the input and one at the output, which are not at ac ground. Thus there are two poles in the circuit.

Two possible bode plots for |Av| arise:

Plot a where only one pole has a 3-db frequency below f_{t}; this is called a dominant pole frequency response. 

plot b where both poles have a 3-db frequency below f_{t}; this is called a non-dominant pole frequency response.

A non-dominant response can give rise to instability issues.
