Two types of MOS transistors exist:
N-Channel MOS (DGS)
P-Channel MOS (SGD) 

The MOS transistor is switched on by applying a voltage $V_{GS}$ at the gate. For the n-channel transistor to switch on:
$V_{GS}\ge V_{T}$ 
where $V_T$ is the threshold voltage

Once the transistor switches on, a thin channel is formed immediately below the silicon dioxide layer, having electrons as the charge carriers. 
Consider a small voltage $V_{DS}$ to be now applied. The result will be that a small current will $I_D$ will start to flow from the drain to the source. For this small $V_{DS}$ The transistor will operate in the ohmic region.

As $V_{DS}$ is increased, typically above $100mV$ the channel is pinched off, the current saturates and the transistor is said to be operating in the pinch-off region

Pinch-off takes place at the drain end of the channel. 
Pinch-off means that the thickness of the channel has become very narrow.
