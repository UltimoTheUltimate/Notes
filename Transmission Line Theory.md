If the transmission line is longer than 10% of the wavelength we must apply transmission line theory.

$v = f\lambda$
where $v$ is the velocity of propagation
$f$ is the frequency
$\lambda$ is the wavelength

for a particular transmission line, $v$ is constant.

lumped element model consists of:

inductance per unit length, resistance per unit length, Capacitance per unit length and Conductance per unit length.

L,R,C,G => primary parameters of a transmission line. (per unit length)
